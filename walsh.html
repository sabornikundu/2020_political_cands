          <p>
          D opposes passing any laws to restrict gun ownership, and in Congress, he sponsored bills that would have loosened restrictions on gun sales.

        <li class="topics"> <br> <br> Climate </li>
          <p>
          D previously said the science behind climate change is “not definitive” and that the US’s economic interests should precede any discussion on combatting climate change. But last month, D criticized Trump for skipping a key G7 meeting about addressing climate change. D told Woodruff he believes human activity impacts climate change. He also criticized the Republican Party for its relative lack of action on the matter, telling Woodruff, “The Republican Party has to acknowledge it’s a problem. This president won’t.”  </p>
        <li class="topics"><br> <br> Abortion </li>
          <p>
          D is pro-life without exception, voted YES on banning federal health coverage that includes abortion, prohibits federal funding for abortion, prohibited forced abortions by UN Population Fund, and prohibits federal funding to groups like Planned Parenthood.</p>
        <li class="topics"> <br> <br> LGBT+ </li>
          <p>
            D said he is a strong supporter of “traditional marriage” and believes “marriage can only exist between one man and one woman.” While he was in Congress, D voted to prevent federal funds from being used in ways that would counteract the Defence of Marriage Act (DOMA).
            D has called LGBTQ activists “constitutional terrorists” and once said that a “transgender ‘man’ is a woman.” He also said Christian vendors should be allowed to turn away LGBTQ customers.
            D opposes Trump’s ban on transgender troops in the military.
