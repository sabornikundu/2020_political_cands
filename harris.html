          <p>
          Kamala Harris is a strong advocate for gun control and believes in imposing restrictions on the right to bear arms. She believes no gun ownership for dangerous convicts or mentally ill. Harris said she wants to bring a rational approach to issues such as drug policy and gun control that doesn't cast them as all-or-nothing choices, though she took liberal positions on those issues. "It's just pretty simple, reasonable stuff. If somebody has been convicted of a felony that proves them to be a dangerous person, they should not be able to own a gun. If somebody has been found by a court to be mentally ill to the point that they are a danger to themselves or other people they should not be able to own or possess a gun," she said.</p>
        <li class="topics"> <br> <br> Climate </li>
          <p>
            Harris supports the Paris climate accord, and believes action is needed to combat climate change. As California’s attorney general, Harris launched an investigation into Exxon Mobil in 2016, after reports that the oil and gas giant lied for decades about the risks of climate change. Harris criticized President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Additionally, Harris opposed the Trump administration’s proposal to reverse Obama-era fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks. Harris voted against repealing regulations on methane emissions, and has a 100 percent lifetime score from the League of Conservation Voters, which tracks lawmakers’ voting records on energy and environmental issues.          </p>

            She rated 100% by NARAL, indicating a pro-choice voting record, supports public funding for abortion services, opposes parental notification for abortions by minors, keeps federal funding for family planning clinics, and was endorsed by EMILY's list for pro-choice Democratic women.

        <li class="topics"> <br> <br> LGBT+ </li>
          <p>
            Harris has a staunchly pro-LGBT record. As California attorney general, she declined to defend California’s ban on same-sex marriage Proposition 8 in court. When the U.S. Supreme Court restored marriage equality to California, she officiated at the wedding of Kris Perry and Sandy Stier, the first same-sex wedding after the ruling, and instructed clerks to marry same-sex couples seeking a license with “no exceptions.” Also as attorney general, Harris in 2015 refused to certify a “Kill the Gays” ballot initiative proposed in California that would have (unconstitutionally) instituted the death penalty for homosexual acts. Despite a legal challenge, a federal judge agreed to relieve her of duty to prepare a title and summary for the measure before it advanced to the signature-gathering stage. Harris also co-sponsored a bill in the California Legislature with former Assemblymember Susan Bonilla to eliminate the “gay panic” defense in cases of murder or violent crime against LGBT people. Gov. Jerry Brown signed the legislation in 2014, making California, along with Illinois, one of two states in the country to ban the plea.          </p>
