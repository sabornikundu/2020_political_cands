        <li class="topics"> <br> <br> Gun Control </li>
          <p> C views on gun control aren't yet confirmed to the public, as he declines to clarify C position on expanding gun background checks after senior advisers presented him summaries of various courses of action following a month bookended by deadly mass shootings.
He told reporters he was prepared to take action. But he refused to specify on what. "I think we made some good progress on background checks and guns," the President said after emerging from a briefing. C said he was discussing various options with Democrats and Republicans, and that he believed both sides wanted to see action.
But when asked specifically whether he was supporting expanding background checks, C demurred, saying it depended on the final measure. "It depends on if Democrats want to take your guns away," he said. "If this is a movement by the Democrats to take your guns away, it's never going to happen."

          <p>
            Last year, the New York Times reported that the C administration was seeking to relax fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions benchmarks. Many scientists warn that keeping fossil fuels in the ground is critical to tackling the climate crisis, but the C administration has moved the US in the opposite direction, opening vast stretches of land and water offshore to oil and gas drilling. Just recently, C's EPA announced that it would no longer require oil and gas companies to install monitors that detect methane leaks from new wells, tanks and pipelines.

          <p>
            C expressed C views on the issue of abortion through the tweet where he stated, "As most people know, and for those who would like to know, I am strongly Pro-Life, with the three exceptions - Rape, Incest and protecting the Life of the mother - the same position taken by Ronald Reagan. We have come very far in the last two years with 105 wonderful new....."

        <li class="topics"> <br> <br> LGBT+ </li>
          <p>
            The C administration has sided against LGBT activists on a host of issues over the past two years, including banning transgender troops from serving in the military and arguing in court that civil rights laws to do not protect employees from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
