        <li> <br> <br> Gun Control </li>
          <p> His views on gun control aren't yet confirmed to the public, as he declines to clarify his position on expanding gun background checks after senior advisers presented him summaries of various courses of action following a month bookended by deadly mass shootings.
He told reporters he was prepared to take action. But he refused to specify on what. "I think we made some good progress on background checks and guns," the President said after emerging from a briefing. Trump said he was discussing various options with Democrats and Republicans, and that he believed both sides wanted to see action.
But when asked specifically whether he was supporting expanding background checks, Drumpf demurred, saying it depended on the final measure. "It depends on if Democrats want to take your guns away," he said. "If this is a movement by the Democrats to take your guns away, it's never going to happen."
