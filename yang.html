      <li class="topics"> <br> <br> Gun Control </li>
        <p> Andrew Yang is in favor of a licensing system for gun ownership. He stated, “Guns are a major responsibility and thus we need to have common-sense gun safety measures, especially considering that there are already approaching 400 million firearms in the United States. Responsible gun owners should continue to enjoy the right to bear arms, subject to licensing and education requirements that will enhance public safety. But the most dangerous weapons that make mass shootings as deadly as they have become should be banned. ” (yang2020.com)

He plans to build a sustainable economy by transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewable energy, upgrading our infrastructure, and improving the way we farm and use land. He also plans to reverse the damage we’ve done by researching on how to remove carbon from our atmosphere, cooling the planet, and rejuvenating ecosystems.
